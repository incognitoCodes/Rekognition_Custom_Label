# Rekognition_Custom_Label

With Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels, you can identify the objects and scenes in images that are specific to your business needs. For example, you can find your logo in social media posts, identify your products on store shelves, classify machine parts in an assembly line, distinguish healthy and infected plants etc.

Rekognition Custom Labels builds off of Rekognitionâ€™s existing capabilities, which are already trained on tens of millions of images across many categories. So, it uses transfer learning to build the ML model.
